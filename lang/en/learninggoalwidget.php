This tool helps you reflect on the topics you learned
and keeps track of your progress.
On the left side there are the topics and on right side
the learning goals. Each of these goals has a percent near
it representing your progress so far. <br/>
You can change this value, by clicking on the topic or on
the learning goal and then moving the slider
to the desired position. On the right side of each topic
there is an average of the progress that you made on the
learning goals. <br/> <br/>
If you are using a screen reader, you can navigate through the document
with the Tab key. By pressing enter you can expand the topics.
When an action for the keyboard is available, it will be announced.
This tool is optimized for Google Chrome and its extension called
Screen Reader. For an optimal experience we suggest you to use those. <br/>
Under the accessibility icon you can find two buttons to change
the size of the font. If instead you would like to change the zoom
you can press Ctrl and + or Ctrl and -. <br/>
The third icon is used to change the colors of the widget. <br/>
If you are colorblind, there you can find some colorschemes,
that have a dark blue outline. These have a high contrast and
should be suitable to you. <br/> <br/>
We wish you a happy learning experience!';
